# This is the AirBnB Project - The console

## Project Description
The AirBnB clone project starts now untilâ€¦ the end of the first year. The goal of the project
is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

### By the end of the project I will have a complete web application composed by:

### Obtainables 
#### - create data model
#### - manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
